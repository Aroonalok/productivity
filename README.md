## DailyPlanner
 ### Description 
 - Use it to plan your day and stay productive. 
 - Sections are self-explanatory (Happiness section is for gratitude journaling). 
 - Entries can be either textual or diagrammatic.
 - Print multiple hard copies, or better still open the PDF in your favourite note-taking app (**Notability** in my case).
 - Customize by editing the SVG file.
